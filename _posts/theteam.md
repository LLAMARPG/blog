## The Team

We are excited to introduce the development team behind Llama RPG!

Leading the team is MrLlamaSC, who is the creator and man in charge of the project. MrLlamaSC has a passion for video games and has been working on this project for several years.

The developers who are working on the game are starmix, GaryFrancis, paint, mars_9t, and Wraithulek. These talented individuals have a wide range of skills and experiences that are essential for bringing Llama RPG to life.

The project management team is MrLlamaSC, paint, and Epirus. These individuals are responsible for overseeing the development process and ensuring that everything runs smoothly. They are also in charge of coordinating the efforts of the developers and ensuring that the game is on track for release.

Our copywriter, SawyerTC, is responsible for writing the story and creating the lore for the game. He is working hard to make sure that Llama RPG has an engaging and interesting story that players will love.

We want to make it clear that Llama RPG is a passion project for the team. Most of us have full-time jobs, and we're working on this project in our free time. We're doing it because we believe in the game and the experience we want to create for players.

We are excited to share more about the game and our team with you in future updates. Thank you for joining us on this journey and we look forward to sharing more about Llama RPG with you soon!
